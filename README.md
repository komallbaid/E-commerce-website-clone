## About the Project

This project is a front-end replica of the Amazon.com user interface, meticulously crafted using HTML and CSS. The primary goal was to practice and solidify core web development skills, focusing on creating a pixel-perfect layout, implementing responsive design principles, and mastering CSS styling techniques.

**Please Note:** This is a static UI clone and does not include any backend functionality or dynamic e-commerce features. It's purely a visual representation of Amazon's front page.

## Features

The clone accurately replicates several key sections and elements of the Amazon.com homepage:

*   **Responsive Navigation Bar:** Includes the Amazon logo, delivery address, search bar, language/country selector, sign-in/account options, returns & orders, and a shopping cart icon.
*   **Hero Section:** A prominent banner area with a dynamic message and a link to Amazon India.
*   **Product Grid/Shop Section:** Displays multiple product categories in a visually appealing grid layout, each with an image, title, and a "See more" link.
*   **Multi-Panel Footer:** A comprehensive footer with "Back to Top" functionality, quick navigation links (Get to Know Us, Make Money with Us, Amazon Payment Products, Let Us Help You), a re-displayed Amazon logo, and copyright information.
*   **Interactive Elements:** Subtle hover effects on navigation items and product boxes for an enhanced user experience.
*   **External Icons:** Utilizes Font Awesome for various icons across the interface.
